### Debugging

* For MacOS: Install CodeLLDB and use the "LLDB" launch.json configuration
* For Windows: Install the C/C++ extension and Build with MSVC and use the "MSVC" configuration
* For Linux: Install the C/C++ extension and Use the "GDB" configuration

Note: It's also possible to use GDB on Windows under MinGW with the C/C++ extension, but `environment` doesn't seem to work with it, so `Path` has to be edited in `settings.json` for now.
